Natural Language Processing (NLP) with disaster tweets involves applying computational techniques to analyze and understand tweets related to disasters or emergencies.This field utilizes algorithms and models to extract valuable information such as sentiment, location, and urgency from tweets posted during crises. NLP techniques enable tasks such as categorizing tweets into relevant categories (e.g., types of disasters, severity levels), identifying key entities (e.g., locations, people), and even predicting the impact or spread of disasters based on the language used in tweets. This application of NLP aids emergency response teams, journalists, and the public in gaining timely insights and coordinating efforts during disaster situations.
